   For our second Water Tracker implementation, we first used Jin's code base
from the first implementation to start. We then added the necessary additional
features, such as the navigation drawer, history, notification details, and
settings. We used Shared Preferences to share data across the different
activities(for example, from Settings to MainActivity).
   The conversion from oz -> ml is 1 -> 29.5735, but for the sake of simplicity and ease for our
users, we rounded 29.5735 to 30, so 1oz -> 30ml. When the user changes
units, we also implemented features such that the number for which the unit is changing for,
also becomes converted. For example, if the user drank 2oz of water, and the user
wants to change units to ml, MainActivity will show both a change in units, and a change
in the amount(2oz -> 30ml).
   When specifying the ending time of day in settings, the user chooses an hour (military time)
for the end of a day. Now, total intake of water resets to 0 when reaching that time,
and the previous intake is recorded in the previous day. By default, hour reset is 24, which is midnight.
As a result, when the date changes, there is a reset(amount = 0). Whenever user chooses a time less than
24 with custom end-time, we store value of intake in the current date, and if the current time is larger
than end-time, we store the intake value in the next day.
   We have also added toasts, so whenever the user does an activity,
they get a notification that they completed said action as a means
of verification.
   In settings, to set goal and end time, users need to press enter button in given keyboard to save the values. If not, then values will not be adjusted.
